Shopping App üõçÔ∏è
A fully functional Shopping App built with React, Redux, and React Router DOM. The app allows users to browse products, add items to their cart, and proceed with a checkout process. It leverages state management using Redux and navigation using React Router DOM for a seamless experience.

Features
Product Listing: View a list of products with details like name, price, and description.
Add to Cart: Add items to the shopping cart and view the total price of selected items.
Checkout: Simulate a checkout process where users can view their order summary.
State Management: Uses Redux to manage the global state, such as the cart and user preferences.
Routing: Utilizes React Router DOM for navigation between pages (e.g., Home, Product Details, Cart, Checkout).
Responsive Design: The app is mobile-friendly and looks great on all screen sizes.
Technologies Used
React: JavaScript library for building the user interface.
Redux: State management library to handle the global state of the app (e.g., cart).
React Router DOM: For client-side routing to navigate between different pages.
CSS: For styling the app (you can add more details if you're using any specific libraries like SCSS, styled-components, etc.).
